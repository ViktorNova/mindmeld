        <p>Mindmeld is the real time collaborative issue tracker. It keeps your team members up to date on projects, feature, and issues. The simple workflow reduces the time it takes to track issues, leaving you with more time to build your product. Collaborate with the next desk, or the other side of the planet.</p>
